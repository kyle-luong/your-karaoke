  "summaryNarration": "This parody takes a classic track and flips it into a deliciously silly food adventure. From craving baked goods and munching all day to remembering greasy fries, stale chips, and extra cheese, it's a journey through a teen's ultimate food fantasy. Even fancy drinks with a 'main squeeze' become sweet, influencer-worthy treats.",
